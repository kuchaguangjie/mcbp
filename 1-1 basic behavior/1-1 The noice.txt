Issue

* When in public place, there always has people speak loudly, as if nobody is there.
* When on the road, many drivers like to beep all the time, as if he / she is looking for a fight, this will make others feel depressed, or even angry.
* 
* [special case]
* in big city, many electric bicycles who carry passengers, like to beep all the time, this really should be fixed,
	should punish them when they beep loudly,
	if they are caught more than several times, should cancel their qualification, or even confiscate their bicycle,
